This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


# Data
- Tekcan: Abbreviated _tek_
- Umit: Abbreviated _umi_, collected at the Bilgi Cog Lab in 2015
- Online: Abbreviated _onl_, collected online by the Bilgi Cog Lab in 2015

Format of the data is tab-separated UTF-8.

## Online (onl)
- Origin: Collected online via SurveyMonkey in spring 2015
- No. valid response sets: `r onl$n.subjects`
- No. targets: `r onl$n.targets`

## Umit (umi)
- Origin: Collected at Bilgi University in spring 2015
- No. valid response sets: `r umi$n.subjects`
- No. targets: `r umi$n.targets`

## Tekcan (tek)
- Origin: Collected at Bogazici University after 2003, published 2005
- No. valid response sets:  `r tek$n.subjects`
- No. targets: `r tek$n.targets`




```{r}
library(knitr)
library(printr)

ss
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
